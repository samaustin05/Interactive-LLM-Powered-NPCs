In the world of God of War, the game is set in a fictionalized version of ancient Scandinavia, primarily within the realm of Midgard, inhabited by various creatures, warriors, and gods from Norse mythology. Many years have passed since the events of the previous games, where the Spartan warrior Kratos, the former Greek God of War, sought vengeance against the Olympian gods, including his father Zeus. Now, Kratos lives a more secluded life in Midgard with his young son, Atreus, whose mother, Faye (Kratos' second wife), has recently passed away.

The game begins with Kratos and Atreus preparing a funeral pyre for Faye, who requested that her ashes be spread at the highest peak of the nine realms. Their journey is filled with challenges and encounters with formidable foes. They meet the Dwarven brothers Brok and Sindri, who upgrade their weapons, and a mysterious Witch of the Woods, who aids them after they rescue her boar. At the Lake of Nine, they encounter the World Serpent, Jörmungandr, and face a mysterious stranger with godlike powers, later revealed to be Baldur, an Aesir and son of Odin.

Kratos and Atreus learn that the highest peak is in Jötunheim, but the passage is blocked by Odin and Thor. They seek the help of Mimir, a knowledgeable prisoner of Baldur, who instructs Kratos to sever his head and revive it with the Witch's magic. The Witch is revealed to be the Vanir Goddess Freya, and both she and Mimir urge Kratos to reveal his divine nature to Atreus.

As they gather the components to open the portal to Jötunheim, Kratos, Atreus, and Mimir face various obstacles, including Baldur's henchmen, Magni and Modi. Atreus struggles with his identity as he discovers his godly powers, and Kratos must teach him about his true nature. After a series of events, including a journey to Helheim and the retrieval of the Blades of Chaos, Kratos and Atreus confront Baldur, who is revealed to be Freya's son. Freya's spell of protection on Baldur is broken, leading to an epic battle where Kratos ultimately defeats him.

Following Baldur's defeat, Kratos finally reveals his past to Atreus, explaining his role in the downfall of the Greek gods. They travel to Jötunheim, discovering that Faye was a Giant and that Atreus is part god, giant, and mortal. They fulfill their promise to spread Faye's ashes and learn that their journey was foretold by the Giants. Kratos also reveals his given name to Atreus, who was named Loki by his mother.

As they return to Midgard, Mimir warns them of the impending Fimbulwinter and the approaching Ragnarök, which was not expected for another century. The game concludes with a secret ending, where Atreus has a vision of Thor's impending confrontation at the end of Fimbulwinter.

God of War is a critically acclaimed game, praised for its immersive storytelling, stunning visuals, and compelling characters. It expands the franchise's mythology by exploring Norse legends and continues the story of Kratos, now as a father, mentor, and a figure struggling with his violent past. The game's world is rich in detail, combining elements of Norse folklore with the unique narrative of Kratos and Atreus' journey, making it a captivating and immersive experience for players.
